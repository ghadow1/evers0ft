        <h3>A KOTLIN AND JAVA COLLECTIVE</h3>
	      <p>Evergreen is aimed to be a lightweight and modern rendition of the 2005 gamepack, the game engine was built using apollo which is a high-performance, modular RuneScape emulator with a collection of utilities for managing data files and plugins.</p>
        <p>The combination of these two have shown outstanding performance, on my machine while also running the server in standard fixed mode it runs about 11-12ms with resize mode running around 15-17ms but this can vary when you continuously enlarge the game applet, regardless in the majority of its use it stays at 50fps with little to no effort.</p>
